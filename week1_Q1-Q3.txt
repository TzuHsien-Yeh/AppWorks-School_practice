1. Try the statements below in REPL. Please answer that there are correct or not and
explain the reasons.

a. val id = 9527

Correct.


b. var number : Int = 5.6

5.6 is a floating-point literal. 
-> replace Int with Double


c. var title = "Hello Kotlin!"

Correct.


d. val content : String = null

The variable content is expected to be a non-null type String, which can not be null.
-> make it nullable by adding a "?"  
(i.e., val content : String? = null)


e. val number : Double? = 556.6

Correct.

f. var list: List<String>? = listOf(null, null)

The infered type of item in the list is non-null type String. 
-> var list: List<String?> = listOf(null, null)


g. var list: List<String?>? = listOf("Wayne", "Chen")

Correct.


h. list.size

Only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type List<String?>?
-> check the size of the collection by list?.size (list can be null) or list!!.size (asserting that list is not null)


i. list?.size

Correct. 


2. Read the code below, choose the correct answer and explain the reason.
var message = "Hello and welcome to AppWorks School :)"
when (message.length) {
0 -> println("Aye!")
in 1..39 -> println("Your grace.")
in 40..56 -> println("My lord.")
else -> println("You know nothing...")
}

It prints c. "Your grace." because the length of the message is 39. 


3. 
The correct array to the output is 
d. val array = Array(6) { 1000.0.pow(it) }

This creates an array of 6 items, each value is 1000.0 to the power of the index. (i.e., (1000.0)^[i] )
Thus the first item (index = [0]) in the array would be 1000.0^0 = 1.
The second item (index = [1]) would be 1000.0^1 = 1000.0.
The third item (index = [2]) would be 1000.0^2 = 1000000.0, and so on.
